## Overview

Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various healthcare applications, including disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This project aims to enhance the accuracy of medical image segmentation by combining predictions from multiple semantic segmentation models with different backbones. The ensemble technique aggregates the outputs of individual models, leveraging their diverse strengths to achieve better segmentation results.

## Usage

To use the ensemble technique for medical image segmentation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (see [Installation](#installation)).
3. Prepare your medical image dataset (see [Data](#data)).
4. Train or load pre-trained semantic segmentation models (see [Models](#models)).
5. Modify the `ensemble_segmentation.py` script to specify the models and their weights in the ensemble.
6. Run the `ensemble_segmentation.py` script to perform segmentation on your images.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- segmentation_models
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- matplotlib
- NumPy
- pandas

## Data

You can use your own medical image dataset or obtain one from public repositories. Organize your dataset in the following structure:

data/
    ├── train_images/
    │   ├── image1.png
    │   ├── image2.png
    │   └── ...
    └── train_masks/
        ├── mask1.png
        ├── mask2.png
        └── ...


Ensure that the images and corresponding masks are properly aligned and preprocessed.

## Models

You can choose from various semantic segmentation models with different backbones, such as ResNet, EfficientNet, or VGG. Train your models from scratch or use pre-trained weights for better performance. Save the trained models in the `models/` directory or load them directly within the `ensemble_segmentation.py` script.

## Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for sample scripts or notebooks demonstrating how to use the ensemble segmentation technique on sample data. These examples provide step-by-step instructions and visualization of the segmentation results.
